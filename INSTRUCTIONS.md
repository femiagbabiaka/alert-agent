## Some small notes.
- The entire project can be recompiled at any time by invoking `lein uberjar` from the root of the project directory.
- Both the jar at the root directory and the one in the `target/` folder are up to date with the latest code changes.
- The binary can be invoked via `java -jar alert-agent.jar $PATHTOJSONFILE`
- In addition, a repl can be started for the project using leiningen, `lein repl`
